Create a CLI system that implements the full robot assignment: define MovimentoInvalidoException, a Robo class with position and color, movement methods (string and integer overload), food detection, and a RoboInteligente subclass that overrides move so it never repeats the same invalid move and keeps trying until a valid move occurs; create different Main classes for user-controlled and random robot movement (single and multiple robots), show robots moving on a 4x4 matrix with food position, track valid/invalid moves, implement an abstract Obstacle class with concrete subclasses Bomb (robot explodes) and Rock (robot pushed back), manage interactions until food is found or robots explode, and display results; optionally allow delays to visualize moves and use colors for distinction
