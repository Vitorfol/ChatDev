Task:
Create a computer board game with a 40-square board for up to 6 players. Players start at square 0 and are one of three types: lucky (dice roll sum is always >= 7), unlucky (sum is <= 6), or normal. The game must have at least two different player types. Player movement is determined by the sum of two dice, with a bonus turn for double rolls. The board features special squares: squares 10, 25, 38 cause the player to miss a turn; square 13 is a surprise card that can change player type; squares 5, 15, 30 move the player forward 3 spaces (unless unlucky); squares 17, 27 force a player to send an opponent back to start; and squares 20, 35 cause the player to swap places with the one furthest behind. The game must display each player's position, show whose turn it is, and display the dice sum. Messages should appear when players land on special squares. The winner is the first to reach or pass square 40. At the end, display the winner, total moves, and final positions. The implementation must use inheritance and polymorphism. Include a debug mode that lets the user input a destination square instead of rolling dice.
