 As the Chief Product Officer, I suggest we discuss the possible product modalities that would best suit the customer's request for a domino game following its specific domain rules. Based on ChatDev's previous products, some viable options could be Application, Website, or even an Interactive PDF depending on the desired user experience and complexity of the game.

Application seems to be the most suitable choice as it allows for more interactive features and complex programming. However, since the customer specifically mentioned C or C++, developing an application using these languages might require additional resources and time due to their lower-level nature compared to Python, which we have used in the past for similar projects.

Website could also be a good option, as it would allow for user interaction without requiring extensive knowledge of specific programming languages. However, the game's complexity might limit its potential on a website platform.

An Interactive PDF would provide a simpler way to present the rules and possibly play the game, but it may not offer the same level of interactivity or complexity as an application or website.

Now that we have outlined some possibilities, I'd like to hear your thoughts on which product modality you believe would be the best fit for this project. Once we have expressed our opinions and agree unanimously, we can terminate this discussion with "<INFO> [Agreed Product Modality]".

 <INFO> Application (C or C++)

Given the complexity of the domino game following its specific domain rules, it seems that an application developed in either C or C++ would be the most suitable choice. While developing an application using these languages might require additional resources and time due to their lower-level nature compared to Python, they offer more control over system resources and can potentially deliver a high level of performance and functionality for a complex game like this.

A website could also be considered as it would allow user interaction without requiring extensive knowledge of specific programming languages. However, the game's complexity might limit its potential on a website platform. An Interactive PDF would provide a simpler way to present the rules and possibly play the game, but it may not offer the same level of interactivity or complexity as an application or website.

I believe that developing an Application (C or C++) would be the best fit for this project considering the nature of the task and our available resources. Once we have expressed our opinions and agree unanimously on this choice, we can terminate this discussion with "<INFO> Application".

 <INFO> Application (C or C++)

I agree that an application developed in either C or C++ would be the most suitable choice for this project due to its complexity. While it might require additional resources and time, the control over system resources and potential high level of performance and functionality offered by these languages can deliver a superior gaming experience. I support this decision as the Chief Product Officer.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: [create a domino game with the domain rules of its, if possible create it using language C or C++].
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "[create a domino game with the domain rules of its, if possible create it using language C or C++]".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application (c or c++)".

Programming Language: "  * C++"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via   * C++. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).
